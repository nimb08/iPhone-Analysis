# iPhone-Analysis

For the iPhone sales analysis task, I have collected a dataset from Kaggle containing data about the sales of iPhones in India on Flipkart.


So this is how you can analyze the sales of iPhones in India using the Python programming language. Some of the takeaways from this article about the sales of iPhone in India are:

  1) APPLE iPhone 8 Plus (Gold, 64 GB) was the most appreciated iPhone in India
  2) iPhones with lower sale prices are sold more in India
  3) iPhones with high discounts are sold more in India
